# Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through three progressively more complex projects that you can build with Folonite.js, covering a range of functionalities from simple task management to building a feature-rich e-commerce platform.

### 1. [Enhanced To-Do List with Filtering & Task Prioritization](todo-list.md)

This project will guide you in creating a robust To-Do List application. You'll learn how to:

- Add tasks with descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
- Implement task filtering (e.g., show only high-priority or due-today tasks).
- Use Folonite.js's built-in dynamic components to render and manage task lists.
- Create a responsive UI that works well across different devices.

This project is an excellent starting point for understanding how Folonite.js handles state management, dynamic rendering, and user input handling.

### 2. [Movie Review App with Ratings and Search](movie-review.md)

This intermediate project will help you build a movie review app where users can:

- Search for movies by title or genre.
- Add, edit, and delete reviews with star ratings and comments.
- Filter and sort reviews by highest rating, most recent, or most popular.
- Integrate external APIs (optional) to fetch real movie data for more realistic use cases.

You will also learn how to use Folonite.js's SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and streaming capabilities to improve performance while handling large datasets and user interactions.

### 3. [E-Commerce Platform with Shopping Cart and Checkout](ecommerce.md)

In this advanced project, you will build a fully functional e-commerce platform with features such as:

- Product listings with categories, prices, and descriptions.
- A shopping cart system that tracks items, quantities, and total price.

This project dives deep into Folonite.js's advanced features like dynamic page routing, real-time data updates, and using the external marketplace to import components that streamline the development process. Additionally, it demonstrates how to create a modular, scalable app architecture that can easily grow in complexity.

Each project is designed to teach you how to effectively use Folonite.js in real-world scenarios, helping you understand both the basics and the more powerful capabilities of the framework. By the end of these tutorials, youâ€™ll be able to build production-ready applications with ease!
